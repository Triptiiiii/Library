Database desiging concept

Study about : SQL - Normalised form

Keep in mind below points:
1. Try to make seperate table for each entity. (e.g : Customer, Product, Contry,)
2. All information related to that Entity should be in same table (Customer, ID, Phone, address,,)
3. At any condition same data should not be at 2 places
4. for mibile number u can not use int because int range is -2,147,483,647 to 2,147,483,647.
Try in DB for your understanding.......tinyint, int




5. Query...I am not doing today because u still need to spend more time on understanding DB design.
