This project is about Library Management System ie LMS.
LMS is an application which is built to manage all the functions of a traditional Library in a Digital way.
LMS allows librarians to keep track of books, journals, magazines, and other library materials.
It also collects the data of borrowing and returning of these library materials.
The primary objective of the LMS is to Add, Delete, View, Issue Books and make available all the data for the Users.
LMS stores all its Data in a database with the help of MySQL.
We are using HTML, CSS and JS technologies for the frontend development of the LMS and for the Business Dev. ,we are using JDBC, JSP and Servlet.
The Deployment of the LMS Project is on Tomcat.Tomcat is a popular web server and servlet container that is widely used for deploying Java web applications. 
Actors---
There are 3 Actors involved in the LMS ---
User--User is an actor which sends request to the Librarian for the data.
Librarian--As Librarian is a second Actor ,who recieves the req. from the Actor1(User) as well as sends that req. to the System and delivers the data as a response to the User.
System/Application.--System is a platform where the Actor2 (Librarian) sends req. to the Actor3 (System) and then the Librarian selects the specific Books or Journals from the Application and sends it as a response to the End User.
